# Upgrading

## Upgrading to 2.0.0~alpha7

After upgrading to `2.0.0~alpha7-1`, users will have to
re-authenticate to the Sensu Backend API. To re-authenticate, users
must run `sensuctl configure` on their workstations.

## Help

During the Alpha, you can contact Sensu for support requests, to
report bugs, or to provide feedback by e-mailing sensualpha@sensu.io.
